Preprocessing Steps
The preprocessing aims to prepare the employee dataset for analysis by ensuring data quality and consistency. This involves addressing any issues in the dataset that could affect the accuracy of the analysis.
The steps are
Loading the Dataset: First,the dataset is imported into the Python environment using libraries such as Pandas. This allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the data.
Inspecting the Data: Review the dataset to understand its structure, including checking for data types, missing values, and inconsistencies.
Identifying Issues inlcude: Checking missing Values: Determine if any columns have null or NaN values.
Inconsistent Formats: Ensure that all entries in columns are formatted consistently.
Correcting the "Height" Column:The "Height" column contains potentially erroneous or inconsistent data. To address this:
Replace the existing values with random numbers between 150 and 180 cm. This is done using NumPyâ€™s random.randint() function, which generates random integers within the specified range.Ensure that the new values are numeric and suitable for analysis.
Verifying Changes: After making adjustments, confirm that the changes have been applied correctly:
Check for any remaining missing values in the dataset.
Validate that the "height" column now contains only the updated random values.
Final Data Check: Before proceeding to analysis, perform a final check to ensure that the data types are correct for each column, no erroneous entries remain, and all columns are ready for further analysis.
Importance of Preprocessing
Preprocessing is a crucial step in any data analysis project. It ensures that the dataset is clean and reliable, which ultimately leads to more accurate insights and conclusions. In this project, the specific focus on correcting the "height" column helps to maintain the integrity of the analysis, allowing for valid comparisons and interpretations in subsequent steps.

Analysis Tasks Explanation
The analysis tasks aim to derive meaningful insights from the employee dataset, focusing on various aspects such as employee distribution, salary expenditure, and correlations between variables.
Distribution of Employees Across Teams: Understand how employees are distributed among different teams.
Calculate the count of employees in each team. Determine the percentage of employees in each team relative to the total number of employees. A clear overview of team sizes, which can inform resource allocation and management decisions is obtained.
Segregation of Employees by Position: Analyze the workforce composition based on employee positions within the company.
Count the number of employees in each position category. Insights into the structure of the organization and potential areas for recruitment or reorganization can be gained.
Predominant Age Group Among Employees: Identify which age group is most represented in the employee dataset.
Create age bins (e.g., 20-30, 31-40) and count the number of employees in each age group.This helps understanding the demographic makeup of the workforce, which can assist in planning training and development programs.
Team and Position with Highest Salary Expenditure: Pinpoint where the highest salary expenditures occur within the company.
Group the dataset by team and position, then sum the salaries for each group. Identify the team and position with the maximum total salary.This can highlight areas where salary costs are concentrated, providing insights for budget management and financial planning.
Correlation Between Age and Salary: Investigate whether there is a relationship between employee age and salary.
Calculate the correlation coefficient between the age and salary columns. Visualize this relationship using a scatter plot to better understand any trends. Helps identifying potential patterns (e.g., do older employees tend to earn more?) can inform HR policies and compensation strategies.
